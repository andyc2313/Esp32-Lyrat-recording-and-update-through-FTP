# ESP32 Audio Recording and FTP Upload System

## Project Overview

This project is an ESP32-based audio recording system that captures audio data through a microphone, saves it in WAV format to an SD card, and uploads the recorded files to a specified server via FTP. The system is designed to enter deep sleep mode after recording to conserve power and automatically wake up at predetermined intervals to continue operation.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `FtpClient.c` / `FtpClient.h` | FTP client implementation for uploading recorded files to a NAS server. |
| `record and save to SD card.c` | Code for **low-power recording mode**, saving short audio clips to the SD card with deep sleep between recordings. |
| `long time record and upload NAS.c` | Code for **continuous recording mode**, continuously recording audio and uploading files to NAS via FTP. |
| `sdkconfig` | Configuration file auto-generated via `idf.py menuconfig`. Contains selected mode and partition info. |
| `README.md` | This documentation file. |

## ðŸ”§ Mode Selection

Two modes are available:

1. **Sleep Mode** (`record and save to SD card.c`)
   - Records short clips (e.g., 1 min), saves to SD card.
   - Enters deep sleep between recordings for power saving.
   - Suitable for long-term, battery-powered deployment.

2. **Upload Mode** (`long time record and upload NAS.c`)
   - Continuously records audio and saves it temporarily.
   - After recording, uploads audio files via FTP to a NAS server.
   - Suitable for stable power environments and real-time data access.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board (such as ESP-LYRA or other ESP32 boards with audio codec)
- SD card and reader module
- Microphone (compatible with ESP32 audio codec)
- Power supply (battery or USB)

## Software Dependencies

- ESP-IDF framework
- ESP-ADF (Audio Development Framework)
- FTP client library
- FAT file system

## Configuration Parameters

Key parameters that can be adjusted in the code:

- `WAKEUP_TIME_SECONDS`: Deep sleep duration (seconds)
- `RECORD_TIME_SECONDS`: Recording duration per session (seconds)
- WiFi connection parameters (SSID and password)
- FTP server configuration (defined through CONFIG_FTP_SERVER, etc.)
- FTP upload path

## Usage Instructions

1. Install ESP-IDF and ESP-ADF development environments
2. Configure FTP server parameters
3. Set up WiFi connection information
4. Compile and upload the code to ESP32
5. Connect external SD card and ensure microphone is working properly
6. The system will automatically start the work cycle: recording â†’ saving â†’ uploading â†’ deep sleep
